    "# Automated Concept Extraction Using LLMs and Vector Search\n",
    "Traditional entity extraction often requires complex NLP pipelines or custom extractors. We'll demonstrate a more elegant approach that combines LLM capabilities with vector search to automatically identify and link concepts from your text to a structured taxonomy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of the Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach uses two key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `llm:response` predicate: Leverages LLM capabilities to identify significant terms within text\n",
    "* `nearest_neighbor` search: Maps identified terms to formal concepts in our taxonomy\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Chomsky Taxonomy\n",
    "\n",
    "Our repository includes a comprehensive taxonomy covering:\n",
    "\n",
    "* People: Historical figures, philosophers, politicians\n",
    "* Places: Countries, regions, institutions\n",
    "* Concepts: Political theories, linguistic terms, social movements\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll focus on leaf concepts (those without narrower terms) and create embeddings that capture both:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `skos:prefLabel`: Standard terms\n",
    "* `skos:altLabel`: Synonyms and variants\n",
    "\n",
    "Each embedding will be enriched with:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Concept categorization as a property\n",
    "* links to the original taxonomy concept\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure enables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Precise concept extraction from text\n",
    "* Hierarchical navigation of extracted concepts\n",
    "* Relationship discovery through taxonomy connections\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting system provides a powerful way to automatically annotate text with structured conceptual metadata, enabling sophisticated semantic analysis and retrieval. "

    "### Process Overview\n",

    "Our SPARQL query orchestrates a sophisticated pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stage 1: LLM Entity Recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we use llm:response to leverage LLM capabilities for identifying key entities:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The LLM analyzes the input text\n",
    "* Extracts mentions of people, places, and concepts\n",
    "* Returns these as a structured list in the ?response variable\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stage 2: Concept Mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we take each extracted entity and map it to our taxonomy:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use `nearest_neighbor` to find the closest matching concept embeddings\n",
    "* Leverage our pre-established vector ID to concept URI mappings\n",
    "* Retrieve the formal preferred labels and concept metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits of This Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "This two-stage process combines:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The flexibility and contextual understanding of LLMs for entity recognition\n",
    "* The precision and structure of our embedded taxonomy for standardization\n",
    "* The power of vector similarity for handling variations and synonyms\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a robust system that can identify and standardize concepts even when they appear in different forms or contexts within the text."
