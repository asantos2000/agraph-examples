One key purpose is the continued enlightenment and growth of the human mind, striving for a more perfect realization of our present life and the potential future of the human race. This involves a persistent pursuit of the common interest, facilitated by education and the breaking away from traditional constraints. Furthermore, humanity is also tasked with the moral obligation of ensuring the happiness and well-being of all individuals, with the highest and noblest motivations rooted in virtue and goodness. This moral obligation extends beyond mere earthly utility, as humanity is gifted with a consciousness of probity and a moral law that transcends immediate advantageous consequences. Finally, there's an inherent responsibility towards self-regulation and moderation in our appetites and health, maintaining a delicate balance between our intellectual and sensory experiences.\n"

COMMISSION agrees that CONSULTANT shall have the right to control the manner and means of accomplishing the result contracted for herein.

SECONDARY FACTORS: (a) The extent of control which, by agreement, COMMISSION may exercise over the details of the work is slight rather than substantial; (b) CONSULTANT is engaged in a distinct occupation or business; (c) In the locality, the work to be done by CONSULTANT is usually done by a specialist without supervision, rather than under the direction of an employer; (d) The skill required in the particular occupation is substantial rather than slight; (e) The CONSULTANT rather than the COMMISSION supplies the instrumentalities, tools and work place; (f) The length of time for which CONSULTANT is engaged is of limited duration rather than indefinite; (g) The method of payment of CONSULTANT is by the job rather than by the time; (h) The work is part of a special or permissive activity, program, or project, rather than part of the regular business of COMMISSION; (i) CONSULTANT and COMMISSION believe they are creating an independent CONSULTANT relationship rather than an employer-employee relationship; and (j) The COMMISSION conducts public business. It is recognized that it is not necessary that all secondary factors support creation of an independent CONSULTANT relationship, but rather that overall there are significant secondary factors which indicate that CONSULTANT is an independent CONSULTANT.

This means the contractor would be responsible for any legal ramifications. Additionally, if the contractor is found in default of the agreement for any reason, the Commission has the right to terminate the agreement without liability as per the 'Termination' clause. It is also important to note that all activities and files related to the project are subject to review and inspection by the Commission, the state, and the Federal Highway Administration if federal participating funds are used. This is to ensure transparency and compliance with all laws and regulations.\n"
