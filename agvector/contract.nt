<http://franz.com/11.> <http://franz.com/hasContent> " 11. INDEPENDENT CONSULTANT STATUS. CONSULTANT and COMMISSION have reviewed and considered the principal test and secondary factors herein and agree that CONSULTANT is an independent CONSULTANT and not an employee of COMMISSION. CONSULTANT is responsible for all insurance (workers compensation, unemployment, etc.) and all payroll related taxes. CONSULTANT is not entitled to any employee benefits. COMMISSION agrees that CONSULTANT shall have the right to control the manner and means of accomplishing the result contracted for herein.  PRINCIPAL TEST: The CONSULTANT rather than COMMISSION has the right to control the manner and means of accomplishing the result contracted for. SECONDARY FACTORS: (a) The extent of control which, by agreement, COMMISSION may exercise over the details of the work is slight rather than substantial; (b) CONSULTANT is engaged in a distinct occupation or business; (c) In the locality, the work to be done by CONSULTANT is usually done by a specialist without supervision, rather than under the direction of an employer; (d) The skill required in the particular occupation is substantial rather than slight; (e) The CONSULTANT rather than the COMMISSION supplies the instrumentalities, tools and work place; (f) The length of time for which CONSULTANT is engaged is of limited duration rather than indefinite; (g) The method of payment of CONSULTANT is by the job rather than by the time; (h) The work is part of a special or permissive activity, program, or project, rather than part of the regular business of COMMISSION; (i) CONSULTANT and COMMISSION believe they are creating an independent CONSULTANT relationship rather than an employer-employee relationship; and (j) The COMMISSION conducts public business. It is recognized that it is not necessary that all secondary factors support creation of an independent CONSULTANT relationship, but rather that overall there are significant secondary factors which indicate that CONSULTANT is an independent CONSULTANT. By their signatures to this Agreement, each of the undersigned certifies that it is his or her considered judgment that the CONSULTANT engaged under this Agreement is in fact an independent CONSULTANT." .
