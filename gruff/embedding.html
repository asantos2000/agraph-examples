// This file demonstrates how a web page can launch and embed a
// private copy of Gruff that's running on a remote server, and then
// use Gruff's HTTP interface to control Gruff programmatically from
// JavaScript in a web application.  For details on Gruff's HTTP
// interface, see the section "The HTTP Interface to Gruff" toward the
// bottom of the single Gruff document.

// A Gruff feature allows a single "launcher" instance of Gruff to be
// running as a server and listening for requests from web browsers.
// It will launch a separate instance of Gruff for each web page that
// requests one, up to a specified limit.  (It can optionally use the
// launcher instance itself for one client, to minimize the number of
// Gruff executables that are running.)

// Web site creators could simply read this code to learn how to embed
// Gruff in a web page, and optionally also pass Gruff's HTTP commands
// in JavaScript, or they could run this demo after first setting a
// few things up.  See the instructions that appear on this HTML page
// when you display it in a web browser (or the bottom of this file)
// for setup instructions.

// The "Run Gruff Below" button in this example demonstrates how to
// simply embed Gruff in a web page.  It first sends an HTTP request
// to the machine where a server Gruff is running at the known port
// 9009 to request a copy of Gruff.  The reply to that message from
// Gruff will be a port on the same machine for a private instance of
// Gruff that the server Gruff started up for this client.  The
// button's script will then tell the iframe element to visit the
// machine at that port to display its own instance of Gruff.

// Some of the finer points in this code are not necessary, such as
// making it work to directly restart Gruff when the maximum number of
// clients are currently already running, but such things are included
// in case you want to use them.

// You will need to modify this line if Gruff is not running on the
// same machine as the AllegroGraph server.
let agServerMachine = "localhost";

// You will need to modify this line if the AllegroGraph server is
// not running on default port 10035.
let agServerPort = 10035;

// You will need to modify this line if the name of the triple-store
// that's needed for this demo is not actors-extended.
let repoName = "actors-extended";

// These two variables are where Gruff is running in launcher mode.
// These default values can be used when using this demo file as the
// --file-to-publish command line argument, but if this code were in a
// real web page then it may need to to hard-code the actual machine
// and port where the Gruff launcher is known to be running.
let launcherMachine = location.hostname;
let launcherPort = location.port;

// A password can be required with a command line argument
// like "--remote-password secret".  Otherwise this can be null.
// let password = "secret";
let password = null;

// The above is all that you might need to change to run this demo.
// The rest is functionality that can be adapted for a real web page
// or web application.

// The ID of the iframe where Gruff will be embedded.
let gruffFrameName = "gruffFrame";
// Use null to instead show Gruff in a new browser tab.
// let gruffFrameName = null;

// A bit of a hack for a github examples page.
let disabled = true;

// These will get set during the run.

// Each command is (1) a title that you will see, (2) the command

<h2>Embedding Gruff In a Web Page</h2>

<p>Gruff can be embedded in any web page to let readers use Gruff on
your web site.  This file (embedding.html in the Gruff
installation folder) explains how to set up a running example of this.
This file also serves as the example web page itself.  You can adapt
its JavaScript code for use on your own web site.</p>

<p>Gruff needs to be running in a special "launcher" mode on a server
machine that the web browser can reach.  Then your web page can send a
message to the Gruff server that tells it to launch another instance
of Gruff for the reader to use in one area of your page.</p>

<p>Simply embedding Gruff allows the reader to use Gruff by itself as
usual inside the web page.  A more advanced feature is that your web
application can also send custom commands to Gruff.  For example, your
application could derive a set of triples that it wants Gruff to
display, and then send those triples to Gruff.</p>

<p>Your web page needs to include an HTML iframe where Gruff will be
placed.  Your page could start up Gruff when it loads, or it could
have a link or button that does that if the reader so desires.  The
bottom of this example page has widgets and an iframe that demonstrate
this.  The &quot;Run Gruff Below&quot; button sends a message to the Gruff
server that&apos;s running on a known machine and port, telling it to
launch a personal instance of Gruff.  The reply contains the port
where that Gruff instance can be reached, and then the button&apos;s code
tells the iframe to visit the same machine at that port to display
Gruff.  The drop-down list then sends commands to Gruff at that port
to control it externally.  See the JavaScript code in this page for
details.</p>

<p>There are a few steps for setting up this example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Download the actors-extended triples file from the following web page
(toward the bottom of the page).  This example sends custom commands to
Gruff that are based on these particular triples.

<pre><a href="https://franz.com/agraph/gruff/download/"><b>https://franz.com/agraph/gruff/download/</b></a></pre>
</li>

<li>Create a triple-store called actors-extended in the root
directory of an AllegroGraph server, and load those
triples into it.  (If the triple-store has a different name, then
edit this example file to set the variable repoName to the name
of the triple-store.)</li>

<li>Run that AllegroGraph server, typically at default port 10035.
(If the Agraph server is running at a different port, then edit this
example file to set the variable agServerPort to the port.)</li>

<li>Run Gruff in server mode with a command line similar
to the following.  Typically you would run the Gruff that&apos;s
contained in the AllegroGraph server, in the &quot;gruff&quot; subdirectory.
(If Gruff is not going to be running on the same machine as the Agraph
server, then first edit this example file to set the variable
agServerMachine to the name of the machine where the Agraph server
is running.)
</li>

<pre><b>./gruff -- -b yes -l no -x no -o 9009-9013 -t 0 -m 5 --launcher yes -g log.txt --file-to-publish embedding.html &</b></pre>

<p>On Windows, use &quot;gruff.exe&quot; rather than &quot;gruff&quot;.</p>

</ul>

<p>Once everything is set up, tell a web browser to visit
<b>machine:9009/embedding</b>,
where <b>machine</b> is the name of the machine where the Gruff server is
running, such as <b>hazel.mycompany.com</b>, or simply <b>hazel</b> within
a local area network.  If Gruff is running on the same machine as the web
browser that will display it, then this can be <b>localhost</b>.

<p>That will display this example file in the web browser, using a URL
that&apos;s created by the <b>--file-to-publish</b> command-line argument.
(In a real-world case, your web page would take the place of this demo
page, and you would not need to use the <b>--file-to-publish</b> option.)</p>

<p>After visting this page as <b>machine:9009/embedding</b>, the
<b>Run Gruff Below</b> button near the bottom of this page
will embed Gruff into the page.<p>

<p>Here are the meanings of the command line arguments above:</p>

<table>

<tr><td><b>-b yes</b></td>

<td>Runs Gruff in web browser mode rather than desktop mode.</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>-l no</b></td>

<td>Avoids automatically displaying Gruff in a local web browser when
the server starts up, because users will be connecting from their
own web browsers.</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>-x no</b></td>

<td>Avoids exiting the Gruff server when a client exits.  This keeps
the server running as multiple clients connect and disconnect
(sometimes simultaneously), though it also means that you
eventually need to use an operating system tool to end the
Gruff server process.</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>-o 9009-9013</b></td>

<td>Runs the Gruff server at port 9009, and allows clients to run
on ports 9009 through 9013.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>-t 0</b></td>

<td>Starts up Gruff&apos;s HTTP server and makes it share
Gruff&apos;s WebSockets port.  This is what listens for commands
that your web application sends to Gruff, and is not needed if
you are simply embedding Gruff without sending it commands.</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>-m 5</b></td>

<td>Allows Gruff to serve as many as five clients at once.</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>--launcher yes</b></td>

<td>Runs Gruff as a server that will run an instance of Gruff for
each web browser client that requests one (up to a limit).</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>-g log.txt</b></td>

<td>Writes a log file at log.txt in the Gruff folder for
monitoring the usage of the server, such as when different users
connect and disconnect.</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>--file-to-publish embedding.html</b></td>

<td>Publishes this example file that lives in the Gruff directory,
so that web browsers can connect to it at the machine where the Gruff
server is running and at the specified port.  <b>One warning:</b> If
you exit the Gruff server, modify the file-to-publish, and start the
Gruff server again (specifying the same file-to-publish), then
visiting machine:9009/embedding again in your browser will
likely display the <b>previous</b> version of the file-to-publish,
even if you do this in a new browser tab.  And it
will have the previous behavior as well.  This has confused
the developer to no end.  8-)  You will then need to use your
browser&apos;s refresh command to force it to load the modified
file-to-publish so that you can test your most recent changes.
</td></tr>

</table>

<p>Here are a couple more options that can be used to make
Gruff look more like a part of your own application.</p>

<table>

<tr><td><b>--custom-title &quot;Our Graph Visualizations&quot;</b></td>

<td>Replaces the usual title bar text that mentions Gruff with your
custom title.</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>--disable-menus</b></td>

<td>Removes Gruff&apos;s menu bar and disables other interactive
gestures, to restrict Gruff activity to the commands that your
application sends.  (This option does not take an argument.)</td></tr>

</table>

<p><br>The rest of this page demonstrates the functionality that
was described above.  If you&apos;ve done that setup (including
visiting this page by telling a web browser to visit
<b>machine:9009/embedding</b>), then the widgets below
should now work.

<p>Press the <b>Run Gruff Below</b> button to ask the Gruff server to
run an instance of Gruff for this user.  The JavaScript code in this
example file will handle the reply from Gruff and display Gruff in the
invisible iframe that&apos;s below the buttons.  Then select the
custom commands in the drop-down widget in the order that they are
